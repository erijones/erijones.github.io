      <description>Since 2016 I have had the pleasure of through-hiking the Colorado Trail (Fall 2017), the Wonderland Trail (Fall 2019), and the John Muir Trail (Fall 2020). Here are a few pictures from those adventures.

      <description>Everyone has a gut microbiome, full of trillions of microbes, that influences our health. One person&amp;rsquo;s microbiome might give them a stomach ache, while another person&amp;rsquo;s might help them metabolize food more efficiently. I want to figure out how &amp;ldquo;medicine for the microbiome&amp;rdquo; works&amp;ndash; how can a sick person&amp;rsquo;s microbiome be made &amp;ldquo;healthy&amp;rdquo;? Specifically, I am interested in how external interventions (e.g. fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, or a modified diet) influence microbiome composition.</description>

      <description>Teaching and mentorship enriched my graduate school experience. While at UCSB I improved my teaching abilities both by studying pedagogy and through practical experience: as a graduate student I was employed as an instructor of record for an upper-division physics course (Summer 2019), a teaching assistant for a freshman-level calculus-based physics course (Fall 2015), and a teaching assistant for an upper-division complex analysis course twice (Winter 2016 and Winter 2020).</description>

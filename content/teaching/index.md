Teaching and mentorship enriched my graduate school experience. While at UCSB I
improved my teaching abilities both by studying pedagogy and through practical
experience: as a graduate student I was employed as an instructor of
record for an upper-division physics course (Summer 2019), a teaching assistant
for a freshman-level calculus-based physics course (Fall 2015), and a teaching
assistant for an upper-division complex analysis course twice (Winter 2016 and
Winter 2020).

Certificate in College and University Teaching
----------------------------------------------
While at UCSB I received the [Certificate in College and
University
Teaching](http://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/academic/interdisciplinary-emphases-certificate-programs/ccut)
(CCUT). To complete this course I taught an upper-division physics course as
instructor of record (details below), took coursework relevant to college-level
pedagogy, and wrote a literature review studying "best practices" for remote
teaching; since I was employed as a teaching assistant during the coronavirus
pandemic, this research topic was pertinent and timely. **Ultimately this work
was compiled into a Teaching Portfolio, available here
[[link]](../img/ccut_teaching_portfolio.pdf), which contains my teaching philosophy
statement and a quantitative analysis of my teaching based on student
evaluations.**

Instructor of Record teaching Lagrangian/Hamiltonian Mechanics 
----------------------------------------------
As part of completing the CCUT, in Summer 2019 I was the instructor of record
for an upper-division Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics course (PHYS 104 at
UCSB) for a class of 20 students. The syllabus for the class is available here
[[link]](../img/syllabus_104.pdf), and the **full set of course notes
I used for the class are available here
[[link]](../img/104_lecture_notes.pdf).**

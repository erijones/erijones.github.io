I am a statistical biophysicist
-------------------------------

I work with [David
Sivak](https://www.sfu.ca/physics/sivakgroup.html) and the Stochastic
Thermodynamics group at Simon Fraser University as a [Banting](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html)
(2020-22) and [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral) (2022-23) Postdoctoral
Fellow.
I received my PhD in physics from UC Santa Barbara in 2020 after working with
[Jean Carlson](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~complex/) and the Complex
Systems group. 

My research is motivated by "medicine for the microbiome."
----------------------------------------------------------
For example,
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
can permanently alter a person's
microbiome composition, curing associated gastrointestinal diseases like _C.
difficile_ infection. 
I specialize in the stochastic factors that influence microbiome assembly and
cause everyone's gut microbiome to be unique.
I work closely with experimental collaborators to motivate, ground, and test
ecological theory in model organisms, including fruit flies and duckweed.

Here is my [CV](./img/cv_Eric_W_Jones.pdf).

and [experimental](./img/march_meeting_poster_03-06-22.pdf) research.

*"Biological research is in crisis ... we are drowning in a sea of data and
thirsting for some theoretical framework with which to understand it. Although
many believe that 'more is better', history tells us that 'least is best'. We
need theory and a firm grasp on the nature of the objects we study to predict
the rest."* ---Sydney Brenner, 2012

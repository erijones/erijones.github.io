Welcome!
--------
The Jones Lab studies microbiome assembly and spatial structure.
We work with empirical datasets collected by experimentalist collaborators that
study [fruit flies](https://carnegiescience.edu/dr-william-ludington),
[duckweed](https://eeb.utoronto.ca/profile/frederickson-megan/), and [activated
sludge bioreactors](https://www.sfu.ca/biology/people/faculty/sjfowler.html).
Our research is motivated by the prospect of improving microbiome-based
medical therapies like [fecal microbiota transplantation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_microbiota_transplant) in humans.

Dr. Eric Jones works as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of
Physics and Energy Science](https://physics.uccs.edu/) at the [University of Colorado
Colorado Springs](https://uccs.edu) (UCCS), and is affiliated with the [UCCS BioFrontiers
Center](https://biofrontiers.uccs.edu/).
His
[CV](./img/cv_Eric_W_Jones.pdf) and
[publication list](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mdWHIrQAAAAJ&hl=en)
are available online.

<!--- *"Biological research is in crisis ... we are drowning in a sea of data and
thirsting for some theoretical framework with which to understand it. Although
many believe that 'more is better', history tells us that 'least is best'. We
need theory and a firm grasp on the nature of the objects we study to predict
the rest."* ---Sydney Brenner, 2012 --->

I am a quantitative ecologist / statistical physicist
-----------------------------------------------------

I work with [David
Sivak](https://www.sfu.ca/physics/sivakgroup.html) and his Stochastic
Thermodynamics group at Simon Fraser University
as a [Banting](https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html)
and [PIMS](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific/postdoctoral) Postdoctoral
Fellow.
In June 2020 I received my PhD in physics from UC Santa Barbara working with
[Jean Carlson](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~complex/) as part of the Complex
Systems group. I regularly collaborate with experimentalist [Will
Ludington](https://emb.carnegiescience.edu/science/faculty/william-ludington)
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.

My research is inspired by "medicine for the microbiome."
-----------------------------------------------
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is one example of "medicine of the
microbiome" that can permanently alter a person's
microbiome state (*e.g.*, curing _C. difficile_ infection in the process).
I develop ecological theory that explains the mechanism of action of
bacteriotherapies like FMT, using mathematical models of
the microbiome that are characterized and guided by well-controlled
experimental model systems.

Here are links to recent posters that summarize
my [theoretical](./img/sfu_postdoc_poster_03-09-21.pdf) and
and [experimental](./img/march_meeting_poster_03-06-22.pdf) research.
For a list of my publications, refer to my

Here is my [CV](./img/cv_Eric_W_Jones.pdf).

*"Biological research is in crisis ... we are drowning in a sea of data and
thirsting for some theoretical framework with which to understand it. Although
many believe that 'more is better', history tells us that 'least is best'. We
need theory and a firm grasp on the nature of the objects we study to predict
the rest."* ---Sydney Brenner, 2012

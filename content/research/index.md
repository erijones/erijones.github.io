Most people have experienced "gut issues" that led to
diarrhea, discomfort, and other unpleasant symptoms at some point in their
lives. In many cases, our gut microbiome---a complex ecosystem of trillions of
bacteria---has been implicated as a cause of gut maladies. My research is
motivated by ``microbiome-based medicine,'' personalized bacterial
therapies that might one day heal suffering individuals.
An emblematic and contemporary example of these therapies
is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which cures
_C. difficile_ infection by transplanting poo from a healthy donor into a sick
person's gut.

The Jones Microbiome Lab's research is grounded in a practical concern: How can
fecal transplants be made more effective? 

Towards this end, we specialize in the stochastic factors that influence
microbiome assembly and ensure that everyone's gut microbiome is unique. Our
work is empirically grounded in fruit fly
microbiome datasets procured by experimental collaborators. We love to
collaborate: please reach out!

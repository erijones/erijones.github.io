Most people have experienced ``gut issues'' that led to
diarrhea, discomfort, and other unpleasant symptoms at some point in their
lives. In many cases, our gut microbiome---a complex ecosystem of trillions of
bacteria---has been implicated as a cause of gut maladies. My research is
motivated by ``microbiome-based medicine,'' personalized bacterial
therapies that might one day heal suffering individuals.
An emblematic and contemporary example of these therapies
is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which cures
_C. difficile_ infection by transplanting poo from a healthy donor into a sick
person's gut.

My research is grounded in a practical concern: How can fecal transplants be
made more effective? 

Towards this end, I specialize in the stochastic factors that influence
microbiome assembly and ensure that everyone's gut microbiome is unique. While
I am a biophysics theorist, my work is empirically grounded in fruit fly
microbiome datasets procured by experimental collaborators, and I hope to apply
our approaches to other more complex model organisms (with _you_?) in the near
future.
